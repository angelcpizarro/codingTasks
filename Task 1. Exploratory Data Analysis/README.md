# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description

This task involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. EDA is a crucial step in data science that helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical summaries and graphical representations. By learning EDA, you gain essential skills in understanding data structures, relationships, and deriving insights, which are foundational for any data-driven decision-making process.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angelcpizarro/codingTasks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the task directory:
   ```
   cd angelcpizarro/Task-1:-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   *A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation and a set of packages. It helps manage dependencies for different projects separately, ensuring that the packages and versions used in one project do not interfere with those in another.*
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt`
   ```
   
## Usage

To perform the exploratory data analysis:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook titanic.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis step-by-step. Each section includes detailed explanations and visualisations.
